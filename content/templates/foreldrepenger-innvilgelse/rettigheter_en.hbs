The other parent is entitled to a cash benefit in another EU/EEA country that corresponds to parental benefit in Norway. When both parents have earned the right to parental benefit, the period is divided into quotas and a joint period. The same also applies if one of the parents has received a payment that corresponds to parental benefit in another EU/EEA country.
