# You must apply for parental benefit in time

{{#eq behandlings√Örsak "INFOBREV_BEHANDLING"}}

You may be entitled to parental benefit. You should apply four weeks before your first day of parental benefit.

Please, be aware of:

* if a parent starts a new parental benefit period for a new child, you will lose days you have not spent
* parental benefit must be withdrawn no later than the day before the child turns three years old
{{else}}

You may be entitled to parental benefit. The other parent has stated that you will have parental benefit for a period that you have not applied for. In order for these days not to be lost, the person staying at home must apply for these days. If neither of you are going to be home, one of you must apply to postpone the period of parental benefit.
