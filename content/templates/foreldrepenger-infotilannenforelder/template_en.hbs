You may be entitled to parental benefit. You must apply before {{sisteUttaksdagMor}}. This is the day the other parent has the last day of parental benefit. If you do not want to start the parental benefit period immediately after {{sisteUttaksdagMor}}, you must apply to postpone the period. If you apply at a later date, you will lose the days you did not postpone.

**The change of parental benefit law for children born from 1 October 2021**
For children born from and including 1 October 2021, the parents decide when they want to take out the parental benefit. Because your child was born before 1 October 2021, you must apply before the other parent has the last day of parental benefit. You must therefore apply before {{sisteUttaksdagMor}}.
{{else}}

You may be entitled to parental benefit. You should apply four weeks before your first day of parental benefit.

Please, be aware of:

* if a parent starts a new parental benefit period for a new child, you will lose days you have not spent
* parental benefit must be withdrawn no later than the day before the child turns three years old
{{/if}}
{{else}}

You may be entitled to parental benefit. The other parent has stated that you will have parental benefit for a period that you have not applied for. In order for these days not to be lost, the person staying at home must apply for these days. If neither of you are going to be home, one of you must apply to postpone the period of parental benefit.
