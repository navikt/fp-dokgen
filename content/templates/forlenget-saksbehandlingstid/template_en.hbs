To be entitled to a lump sum grant, you must be a member of the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme when the child is born. We have limited information about your situation and need more details to assess whether you are entitled for the lump sum grant.

If you want your case to be assessed before the child is born, you must document that you live permanently in Norway.

Documentation can be, for example:
* Confirmation from your midwife or doctor at which times you have had pregnancy check-ups

* If you attend school or courses, you can send a confirmation from the educational institution

* If you have children who go to school or kindergarten, we can get confirmation of this

* Any other documentation showing that you are staying in Norway permanently

To be entitled to a lump-sum grant, you must have been a continuous member of the Norwegian National Insurance Scheme for the last 12 months before the due date. You have not been a member for 12 months as of today, and we must therefore wait to process your case until closer to the due date.
