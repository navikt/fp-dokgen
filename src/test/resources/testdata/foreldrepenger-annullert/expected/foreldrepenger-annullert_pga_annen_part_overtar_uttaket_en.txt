#  Nav has changed your parental benefit
The previously granted period of parental benefit has been annulled.
The mother has applied to take over your previously granted parental benefit period. Therefore, your parental benefit has ended, but you do not lose any days.
You must apply for a new parental benefit period at [nav.no/foreldrepenger](https://nav.no/foreldrepenger). The parental benefit must be withdrawn no later than the day before the new parental benefit period for a new child begins, or no later than the day before the child reaches the age of three.
When there are 4 weeks left until you are to withdraw your parental benefit, your employer must submit a new income report.
The decision has been made pursuant to section 14-6, 14-7, 14-9, 14-10, 14-11 and 14-12 of the National Insurance Act.
