## We have granted the following
* You will receive 100 per cent parental benefit from 1. april 2021 up to and including 2. april 2021. This corresponds to the percentage of a full-time position that the mother is working. The amount of parental benefit you draw cannot be higher than the percentage that the mother is working.
  Even though you are working during this period, you will not be entitled to an extension of your parental benefit period. In order to combine parental benefit with work and get a longer period of parental benefit, the amount you draw must be lower than the percentage that the mother is working.
