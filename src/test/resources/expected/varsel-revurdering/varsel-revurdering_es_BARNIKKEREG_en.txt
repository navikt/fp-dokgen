Name: Dolly Duck
<br/>
National identity number: 300220 12345

You were expecting 23. mai 2020, but your child is not in the National Registry. You will have to send us a birth certificate before 24. mai 2020.

If the child is born in another country, you will need to inform us about the duration of your stay abroad, and whether you are planning to come back to Norway.

You are entitled to make a statement before the given deadline.

Your duty to give information is according to sections 21‑3 og 21‑4 of the National Insurance Act.
<br/>
<br/>

**The decision about your lump-sum grant can be reversed**
<br/>
We will consider your case again after the deadline has been reached. If you are not entitled to the lump-sum grant, you can be asked to repay the money back.

You can send us information at [nav.no/ettersendelser](https://nav.no/ettersendelser).
