We have received information that you have received sickness benefits for a period when you already received pregnancy benefit. Your pregnancy benefit therefore stops from 10. mai 2021.
If pregnancy benefit becomes relevant from a later date, you must send a new application for pregnancy benefit, and your employer must send a new income report to NAV.
The decision has been made in accordance with the National Insurance Act section ยง 14-4 og ยง forvaltningsloven ยง 35.
