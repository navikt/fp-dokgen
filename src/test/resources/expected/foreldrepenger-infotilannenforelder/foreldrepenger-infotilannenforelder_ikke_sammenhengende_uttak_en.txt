You may be entitled to parental benefit. You should apply four weeks before your first day of parental benefit.
Please, be aware of:
* if a parent starts a new parental benefit period for a new child, you will lose days you have not spent
* parental benefit must be withdrawn no later than the day before the child turns three years old
