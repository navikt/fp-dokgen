We have got your application for parental benefit 1. april 2020, but we have not received all the information we need to process it.
You must ask these employers to submit an income report to NAV:
* Andeby Bank AS with company number 123456789 and where you work 80 percent.
* Andeby Vask AS with company number 99999999 and where you work 10 percent.
If the income report already has been sent from the employer, you can disregard this inquiry.
We have received the income report from these employers:
* Andeby Vaktmester AS with company number 99999998 and where you work 5 percent.
* Andeby Service AS with company number 99999997 and where you work 5 percent.
