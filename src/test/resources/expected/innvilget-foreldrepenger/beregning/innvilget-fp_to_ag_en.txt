**Income we have used in the calculation**<br/>

Your income at ARBEIDSGIVER 2 is 54 321 kroner per month.
Your employers have provided us with this information.
This is the average of your income from the last three months before the start of the parental benefit period. If you have just started working, changed your employment situation or your pay has changed, we have used your monthly income after the change took place.
You will receive 100 kroner per day before tax starting from 15. april 2021 because you are losing your payment in kind from ARBEIDSGIVER 2.
