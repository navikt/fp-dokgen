We have been informed that your children died on 15. august 2021.
This letter is to inform you that we are granting you parental benefit from 13. august 2021 up to and including 25. september 2021.
You will receive 2 455 kroner per day before taxes. This is 53 191 kroner on average per month.
We pay parental benefit to your employer because you receive wages while on leave.
The decision has been made in accordance with the National Insurance Act §§ 14-9, 14-10 og 14-12.
<br/>
**Income we have used in the calculation**<br/>
Your income at ADVOKATEN AS is 75 000 kroner per month. Your employer has provided us with this information.
This is the average of your income from the last three months before the start of the parental benefit period. If you have just started working, changed your employment situation or your pay has changed, we have used your monthly income after the change took place.
Your parental benefit has been stipulated at 638 394 kroner per year, which is six times the national insurance base amount. You earn more than this, but you will not receive parental benefit for the portion of your income that exceeds six times the national insurance base amount.
The calculation has been made in accordance with the National Insurance Act Sections §§ 14-7 og 8-30.
